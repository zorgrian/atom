Atom and all repositories under Atom will be archived, (**which they call sunsetting**) on December 15, 2022. Learn more in thier official sunset announcement. It does look a bit fishy when one considers that ATOM is a direct competitor to the Gates-ware offering.

Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on Electron, and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

*If you even think of plagiarizing, lifting, or stealing whatsoever part of this document, you will be entering a world of pain! There is a warning written…  I lost my train of thought here…  The warning, as it reads, is that if anyone were to steal a book from this collection, let said book change into a serpent in his hand, and rend him to devastation. May he be struck with paralysis and all his limbs unmade. Allow him to worsen without compassion or respite, until he decays into oblivion. Let Book-worms eat his Entrails as a general-purpose sign. Allow him to live out his life throughout all of these horribilis extensive durations, and when he receives his final punishment in hell or wherever, let the fires burn over him for a very long time and hardly ever stop.*

## Documentation

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the Atom Flight Manual is free and available #online. You can find the source to the manual in atom/flight-manual.atom.io.

But, what is the -f point when as #GatesWare bought out #GItHubble it is now destined to go the way of #Muskrat: his spaceships generally go south etc and we must draw a line in the sand.

The API reference for developing packages is also documented on Atom.io.

Installing

Prerequisites

- Git

macOS

Download the latest Atom release.

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

Windows

Download the latest Atom installer. AtomSetup.exe is 32-bit. For 64-bit systems, download AtomSetup-x64.exe.

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

You can also download atom-windows.zip (32-bit) or atom-x64-windows.zip (64-bit) from the releases page.

The .zip version will not automatically update.

Using Chocolatey? Run cinst Atom to install the latest version of Atom.

## Linux

Atom is only available for 64-bit Linux systems.

Configure your distribution's package manager to install and update Atom by following the Linux installation instructions in the Flight Manual.  You will also find instructions on how to install Atom's official Linux packages without using a package repository, though you will not get automatic updates after installing Atom this way.

Archive extraction

An archive is available for people who don't want to install atom as root.

This version enables you to install multiple Atom versions in parallel. It has been built on Ubuntu 64-bit,

but should be compatible with other Linux distributions.

1. Install dependencies (on Ubuntu):

    sudo apt install git libasound2 libcurl4 libgbm1 libgcrypt20 libgtk-3-0 libnotify4 libnss3 libglib2.0-bin xdg-utils libx11-xcb1 libxcb-dri3-0 libxss1 libxtst6 libxkbfile1

1. Download atom-amd64.tar.gz from the Atom releases page.
2. Run tar xf atom-amd64.tar.gz in the directory where you want to extract the Atom folder.
3. Launch Atom using the installed atom command from the newly extracted directory.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to

repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.
